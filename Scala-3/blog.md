# Scala 3 - and what it means to me

## Why read this?
There are a whole bunch of changes that come with Scala 3. This is my opinionated selection of the noteworthy changes and how I feel about them! 
If you (and your team) are anything like me (and mine) then hopefully this will be relevant to you!


## Introduction
First of all I want to say a huge thank you to the folks who have been working hard on Scala 3 and that I‚Äôm excited to start enjoying the benefits in my everyday work.

Scala 3 is built on a new foundation called **DOTTY**. The name **DOTTY** comes from [Dependent Object Types (DOT)](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~amin/dot/fool.pdf) which is the calculus for path-dependent types. The important take-away is that after 8 years of experience refining Scala, the team behind the language have specifically designed DOTTY to model a Scala-like language and become a strong new foundation that will enable Scala to be the language they want it to be. DOT is also **simpler** than the previous foundation, and places emphasis on accessibility and safety.

## 1 Dropped and changed features - some "warts" removed

### Automatic Eta Expansion

This makes me so happy! üòÑ

A fundamental requirement for a functional language is that you can pass around functions in just the same way as data. 
Now, because scala makes the distinction between *methods* (which are not objects) and *functions* (which are), there are certain situations 
where you need to tell the compiler you want to convert a *method* to a *function* so that it can be passed around. 

_Scala 2:_

``` scala
def foo(a: Int) = a + 1         // This is a method

val fooFunction = foo _         // This is a function
```

The requirement to add an `_` is awkward and confusing for new Scala developers. Thankfully that requirement has gone.

_Scala 3:_

``` scala
val fooFunction = foo           // This is a function
```


You can read more about this **wart** in Lihaoyi's excellent blog [Scala Warts - Weak Eta Expansion](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/WartsoftheScalaProgrammingLanguage.html#weak-eta-expansion)

### Bye bye package object

Package objects are no longer needed since all kinds of definitions can now be written at the top-level. 

``` scala
package helloworld

def add(x: Iny, y: Iny) = x + y

final case class Person(name: String, age: Int)

val bob = Person("bob", 42)
```

This also makes me happy. üòÑ

The restriction that everything you write needs to live inside an object, class or trait was not needed, and 
package objects were clearly just a special case of object that attempted to alleviate this problem. 
This is nice, more warts removed.

#### üïäÔ∏è To migrate üïäÔ∏è

You will not be required to migrate initially, in Scala 3.0 package objects are only deprecated.
That said, it shouldn't be too hard!

``` scala
package fish

package object nemo {
    val friend = "Dory"
}
```

becomes

``` scala
package fish
package nemo

val friend = "Dory"
```

I expect there will be tools to do this automagically.

### Limit 22

For most people reaching this limit has been a rare thing and often easy to workaround - though my team has encountered this problem (in config loading). 

This makes me smile. üôÇ

In dotty we can go beyond `Tuple22` and `Function22`. So we can all start writing our apps like this

``` scala
def makeEarth(
    init:           Planet,
    mountains:      Planet => Planet,
    oceans:         Planet => Planet,
    trees:          Planet => Planet,
    grass:          Planet => Planet,
    insects:        Planet => Planet,
    fish:           Planet => Planet,
    bears:          Planet => Planet,
    badgers:        Planet => Planet,
    snakes:         Planet => Planet,
    tigers:         Planet => Planet,
    caves:          Planet => Planet,
    lakes:          Planet => Planet,
    volcanoes:      Planet => Planet,
    geysers:        Planet => Planet,
    deserts:        Planet => Planet,
    crystals:       Planet => Planet,
    buriedTreasure: Planet => Planet,
    coal:           Planet => Planet,
    people:         Planet => Planet,
    food:           Planet => Planet,
    roads:          Planet => Planet,
    swimmingPools:  Planet => Planet,
    sheep:          Planet => Planet,
    dragons:        Planet => Planet,
    pillows:        Planet => Planet
): Planet = ???
```

### Tuples concat!

``` scala
(1, "thing", 3.14, false) ++ ("more", "and", 2, "more")
> (1, "thing", 3.14, false, "more", "and", 2, "more)
```

Enough said! ‚ù§Ô∏è


### XML literals

Deprecated, to be replaced with xml string interpolation:

``` scala
xml"..."
```

For those who use XML literals it might come as a blow. It seems the reason to drop this is for simplification - including
XML literals in the language places a great burden on the language that some feel is not justified, and instead string interpolation
can achieve the same end result, allbeit without some of the compile-time safety.

For me and my team, this has no impact, but it is certainly noteworthy. See this [discussion on the original proposal](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/proposal-to-remove-xml-literals-from-the-language/2146/81). The TLDR is that it has been shown that the **Lift** framework still compiles after a re-write and using
a thrid party interpolator. Thoguh there is still some way to go to prove that it all still works correctly.

### No more Auto-Application

This is now an error

```scala
def next(): Fish = ...
next // no longer expanded by the compiler to "next()"
```

I like this. üëç

I like it because code will become more consistent. The parens `()` should be reserved for side-effecting code. So typically methods that return Unit.
This conforms to the *uniform access principle* that allows properties to be either fields `val x` or methods `def x` without affecting the calling code.
Therefore, side-effects are not properties and should not be permitted to be accessed as properties.

```scala
object Thing {
    def iChangeTheWorld(): Unit
}

Thing.iChangeTheWorld() // Not possible to write: "Thing.iChangeTheWorld" So the parens () tell us that this code has an effect
```

With this restriction in place the decision to write your methods with or without `()` is something that will become natural and make code easier to read.

In fact, there are even mistakes in the Scala 2 libraries - in particular `def toInt()` !

#### üïäÔ∏è To Migrate üïäÔ∏è

Your code can still be compiled in Dotty under -language:Scala2Compat. 

When paired with the `-rewrite option`, the code will be automatically rewritten to conform to Dotty's stricter checking.

## 2 New features!

### Types - intersection and union

#### Intersection types

```scala
trait HasAge { def age: Int }
trait Named { def name: String }

def introduce(ab: Age & Named): String =  {
    s"My name is ${ab.name}, I am ${ab.age} years old"
}
```

Well, we sort of already have this. Whenever you write `with` you create a **Compound Type**.

```scala
trait CooksBread { def cook(bread: Bread): Toast }
trait Pops { def pop: Sound }

trait Toaster extends CooksBread with Pops
```

But as it stands, **Compound Types** do not obey some properties, notably the `commutativity` law. 

What this means is that these are not always the same:

```scala
trait AB extends A with B
trait BA extends B with A
// AB != BA    :(
```

It's not typically a deal breaker, but you can appreciate that fixing this is a nice simplification. üëç

The problem comes when A and B share the same member (e.g. both have a `def children`). 
Scala 3 solves this by making
1) the new member an intersection will have a type that is the intersection of it's parents' types (see `children`)
2) Forcing you to override conflicting members (see `name`)

```scala
trait A {
  def children: List[A] 
  def name: String = "A"
}
trait B {
  def children: List[B] 
  def name: String = "B"
}
class C extends A with B {
  def children: List[A & B] 
  def name: String = "C"
}
val x: A & B = new C
val ys: List[A & B] = x.children
x.name // "C"
```

Since List is covariant the intersection of `List[A]` and `List[B]` is `List[A & B]`.  Pretty nifty 

(Intersection types - reference)[https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/new-types/intersection-types.html]

#### Union Types

This follows a similar story to the intersection types above. In short, we can provide unions with `|`

```scala
val eitherStringOrInt: String | Int = if (condition) "Fish" else 0
val eitherManWomanOrChild: Man | Woman | Child = if (age <  18) Child() else if (mansplaining) Man() else Woman()

eitherManWomanOrChild.eat(toast) // everyone can eat toast
```

### Enums

The Enumeration in Scala 2 are problematic to the point that nobody uses them. Instead we use `selaed trait` and rely
on libraries like `enumeratum` to get nice enum behaviour. 

Current problems:
1) Enumerations have the same type after erasure.
2) There‚Äôs no exhaustive matching check during compile.
3) They don‚Äôt inter-operate with Java‚Äôs enum.

Essentially it looks like Scala 3 implements `enum` in much the same way as `enumeratum` as a sealed trait, but making this
a first class language feature is a nice win as a developer. 

I spend less time writing more boilerplate and adding dependencies, and less time explaining to newcomers why we even need to do that. 

Libraries should also provide more consistent support - it becomes less of an "optional" thing to provide support for `enumeratum`.
